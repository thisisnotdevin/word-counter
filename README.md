# WordCounter
This simple word counter allows you to type text in a text box and the counter will show how many words are in there, another way is that you can paste a long paragraph and it will show how many words in that paragraph. It also includes a easter egg button.

## Installation
* To begin, make a clone request `git clone https://github.com/thisisnotdevin/word-counter`on this project and open it, in my case I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 
* VSC is a good enviroment to edit and see this file easily, after that I recommend downloading the live server extension from the market.
* Once you have done all the steps above you can right click on `index.html` the file and press **Open Live Server** and the programs should pop up on your browser.
* VSC is quick and efficient it allows you to change code and view it on the live server instantly. 

## Usage
Sometimes it is really helpful to know how many words are in a text, for example your professor wants you to write a 9000 word essay, this program can keep in track how many you have written so far.
